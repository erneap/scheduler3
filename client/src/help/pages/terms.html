  <h1>Scheduler Overview</h1>
  <h2>Terms</h2>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li><b>Assignment</b> – This refers to the normal work 
      schedule over a period of time.  All employees have 
      at least one assignment which also annotates when the 
      employee started working for the team/site and when 
      their last day of work was.  An assignment can have 
      multiple schedules.  If multiple schedules are to be 
      used and rotated through, the assignment can designate 
      a date to rotate upon and the number of days between 
      changes.  The selection of the assignment workday by 
      date is checking for a rotation period and date, 
      finding which schedule to use, then determine with 
      days within that schedule to provide.</li>
    <li><b>Schedule</b> – The schedule is defined as a 
      group of days (must be a multiple of 7) to be used to 
      define the workdays for the assignment.  All schedule 
      days start on a Sunday (first day of the week) and 
      include a multiple of 7 days.</li>
    <li><b>Workday</b> – A workday contains the work code for a particular day 
      numbered within the schedule, the work center assigned for that work and 
      the number of hours expected to be worked.  A blank workday includes a 
      blank code, a blank work center and zero hours.</li>
      
    <li><b>Variation</b> – A variation is defined as a temporary alteration in 
      the employee’s normal work schedule.  As an example:  The employee works 
      Tuesday through Saturday, 8 hours per day, working day shift in the GEOINT 
      work center, but you need them to work Mid Shift for 4 weeks.  You create 
      a variation with the scheduled start and end dates for the variation, 
      plus assign the variation’s schedule to the proper mid work code, work 
      center and number of hours.  If the site is using a mid-rotation, you 
      should set the IsMids flag of the variation to true.  A variation only 
      has one schedule and can be set to whatever multiple of 7-day period to 
      use.</li>
      
      <li><b>Leave</b> – A leave is any non-workday.  It could be vacation time, 
        a holiday, military or jury duty, or a few other options.  These are 
        started by completing a leave request and the individual’s supervisor 
        approving the leave.  All leaves include a leave code to show what type 
        of leave it is and the number of hours to be used.  The system 
        automatically adds a leave status (Actual, Approved, or Requested) to 
        show where the leave is in the process.
        <ol class="level2">
          <li><b>Actual Status</b> – This is normally determined by ingestion 
            of the timecard data or from the company lead’s timecard manual 
            input.</li>
          <li><b>Approved Status</b> – This signifies that the supervisor has 
            approved the leave request and will remain in this status until the 
            timecard data modifies the status that the leave was actual taken.</li>
          <li><b>Requested Status</b> – This signifies that the employee has 
            requested the leave, but the supervisor hasn’t approved it yet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Team</b> - A team is a group of employees working for a particular 
        purpose.  This could be an entire IT team or grouped to cover a single 
        contract or group of related contracts.  A team is normally composed of 
        a leadership team and at least one site.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Site</b> - A site is an organization within the team, either 
        geographically or functionally separate.  It normal consists of a 
        leadership team plus at least one workcenter.
      </li>
      <li><b>Workcenter</b> - A workcenter is the assigned work area/function 
        an employee works at.  Workcenters are normally divided by work shifts 
        and/or positions so that employees can be assigned within and displayed 
        properly.  These shifts and positions are defined within the site and 
        workcenter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Ingest</b> - This is either a file upload or manual entry process to 
        provide actual work and leave information to the database.  File upload 
        is currently restricted to SAP Excel exports and the manual entry 
        process provides a worksheet type view for entry with approved leave 
        already shown.  In the manual process, every cell must be entered to 
        update that particular date, this includes all leave dates.  Upon exit 
        of the cell, the data is sent to a recorder for update when approved.
