  <h1>Scheduler Overview</h1>
  <p>
    This web-based application was developed to ease the 
    burden on administrators in providing a comprehensive 
    team/site/employee schedule and produce the  
    reports required by the various customers.  A team is 
    the overall group that is usually divided into sites 
    with a leadership element.  A site also has a small 
    leadership team and broken down into work centers where 
    most of the employees are assigned.

    This tool will allow each user to see various aspects 
    of the application depending on their role within the 
    team and site.  The roles include:
    <ol class="level1">
      <li><b>Employee</b> – Everyone with a access account on 
      this application is initially an employee.  This is 
      the lowest common denominator and is given the least 
      privilege to updating necessary data.</li>
      <li><b>Site Scheduler</b> - The site leader will 
        select this individual who will be responsible 
        setting all site employee’s schedules and variations 
        (these terms explained later).  This person will 
        also prepare the site’s reports and email it out 
        to the various recipients.  They will also be able 
        to edit employee data to include their profiles, 
        change passwords, unlock accounts, edit company 
        information, assign primary labor codes, edit 
        approved leave, edit leave starting balances and 
        submit leave requests for the employee.</li>
      <li><b>Site Company Lead</b> – Since the team is 
        probably composed of a main company plus a portion 
        of the team composed of personnel from other 
        companies.  Work completed and leaves taken require 
        are included in the timecard ingest/manual entry 
        and this is the responsibility of the site’s 
        company leads.  They ensure their timecard system 
        data is ingested or manually entered, so this is the 
        area the site company lead has access to.</li>
      <li><b>Site Leader</b> – Site leadership isn’t just 
        the site lead, but also anyone assigned a leadership 
        position where assignment actions are decided, and 
        leaves approved.  A Site Leader has all the 
        permissions of the Site Scheduler plus leave 
        approval.</li>
      <li><b>Team Leader</b> – Team leadership are the 
        overall decision makers deciding on team composition 
        and contract maintenance.  Because of this, they 
        are granted the capability to add/edit/delete sites 
        and their employees.</li>
      <li><b>Application Admin</b> – This is the highest 
        role in the application and granted only to the 
        application administrator(s).  They have full 
        permissions to add/edit/delete teams plus purge old 
        data by date.</li>
    </ol>
