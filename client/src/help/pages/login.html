    <li><b>Logging In</b>
      <p>Only authorized individuals can access the data associated with This
        web application, so you must log into the system for access.</p>
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>Type in the user's registered email address into the space provided
          as shown above.
        </li>
        <li>The next text entry area is for the account’s password.  It 
          doesn’t display, but display’s only a string of asterisks for each 
          character typed in.</li>
        <li>Click the “Login” button below the password entry area to send 
          the login information to the server to log in.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If the information sent is accurate, the employee calendar portion of 
        the application will be shown, otherwise you may see a login status 
        message to the left of the log in button.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Staying Logged In</b> - After log in, the server will communicate 
    with the browser and pass credentials to it to maintain your logged in 
    status for a period of time.  If you are inactive for that period the 
    credentials become invalid and your next action will return you to the 
    log in view.</li>
    <li><b>Logging Out</b> - Once you are logged into the application, you will 
      stay logged in, for a period of time, even if you refresh your browser.  
      To remove this capability, log out of the application by clicking the 
      lock in the toolbar.  This will log you out and return the browser 
      display to the log in screen</li>
