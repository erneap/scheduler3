    The site is initially defined by three basic pieces of information and the 
    editor allows you to edit each piece.
    <img src="./images/sitebasic.png">
    <ol class="level1">
      <li>
        First is the site's title.  What do you call the site and/or location?  
        This is the spot you edit this.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second input is a Yes or No for a rotational mid-shift at the site.  
        A site may have a requirement for a minimally manned midnight shift, 
        manned on a rotational basis.  The assignment of employees to this 
        shift is handled as employee variations, but the system needs to know 
        if the site will use this feature.  Choose "Yes" or "No" to signify 
        whether or not the site will use rotational mid-shifts.
      </li>
      <li>
        The last value on this view is for Zulu (GMT/UTC) offset.  This value is 
        between -12.0 to 12.0 and is the number of hours your site's local time 
        is in relation to Zulu, Greenwich Mean Time or Universal Time Coordinate.  
        Example:  Hawaii Standard Time is -10 hours from Zulu.
