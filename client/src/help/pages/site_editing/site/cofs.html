  <h1>Site Editing Overview</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>
  <p>
    The site is the local grouping of employees associated with a mission or 
    missions.  
    <ol class="level1">
      <li>
        It is normally lead by a single individual designated by the 
        lead company and responsible to the company contract leadership for the 
        accomplishment of the objective.  
      </li>
      <li> 
        Site will normally have at least one workcenter in which employees 
        are scheduled to work.  Workcenter's can, in turn, be populated with 
        positions and/or shifts for work assignment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The site is also the level where two of the report types are defined. 
        These two report types are the local charge number status and the 
        certificate of service reports.  They will both be described and the 
        process for creation will be explained in later portions of this 
        tutorial.
      </li>
    </ol>
