  <h1>Site Forecast Report Editing</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>
  <p>
    The forecast report is a excel-based output that allows the site 
    leadership to track contract accomplishment.  Each contract for support 
    breaks up its accomplishment into periods of time with an allotted number 
    of hours per employee per function.  Based on the scenario given 2 forecast 
    report elements need to be created for reporting accomplishment.  These are 
    aligned with the contracts.

  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      <b>Getting the Forecast Report View</b>
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>Click the "Site Editor" menu choice on the left.  This will open 
          the site editor view, normally in the basic site editing subview.
        </li>
        <li>Click the "Report Editor" tab at the top of the site editor view.
          This will open the report editor subview, with the Site Forecast 
          Report Editor showing.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Create a New Forecast Report</b>
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>
          Click the "Create New Report" item from the Forecast Report List.  
          This list shows only the forecast report elements that are active 
          (those with the current date between the report's date range) or 
          in the future.  The "New Report" selection will show three areas for
          entry. 
        </li>
        <li>Type in the new forecast report element name, in this case we'll 
          use "Demo_One".  Use underscore characters instead of spaces between 
          words.  This will be used in the forecast report for the different 
          excel sheets (one each for actual hours and forecast hours).
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the calendar icon to display the date calendar and click the first 
          date for the contract and a second click on the last day of the 
          contract.  You will probably have to use the &lt; and &gt; buttons at 
          the top of the calendar to move the calendar to see the dates needed.  
          After the second click, the contract dates should be shown, if not, do 
          this step again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, select which day of the week is used as the end of the reporting 
          week, this will normally be Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, but you can 
          choose any day of the week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, click the "Add" button to create the basic forecast report 
          element.  It will create weekly and monthly reporting periods for the 
          report.  These can be adjusted later.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Adjusting the Report Periods</b>
      The reporting months will initial contain all the fridays for that 
      particular month, but the contract adminstrator may tell you that a week 
      should be in a different report month.  For this scenario we are going to 
      move the first weeks in September and December to the previous month.
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>
          Click on the month initially containing the week to move (either 
          first or last Friday listed).  In this case, we'll click on 12/2003.
        </li>
        <li>Click on the "&lt; First Week" button to move the first of the selected 
          month's weeks to the previous month or the "&gt; Last Week" button to 
          move the last of the selected month's weeks to the next month.
        </li>
        <li>
          We would repeat this process for the other month to change.
        </li>

    <li>
      <b>Labor Codes</b>
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>
          <b>Add a New Labor Code</b>
          In our scenario for "Demo One", we need to add four (4) labor codes 
          for the site lead, 2 shift supervisor and worker for workcenters 1 and 
          3.  The only required fields are the Charge Number, Extension, Number 
          of Slots, Hours per employee and the usable period. I'll use the site 
          lead's labor information for this sample.
          <ol class="level3">
            <li>Click the "Add New Labor Code" item in the list.</li>
            <li>Type in the data for the Charge Number/Extension (2023 and 
              SiteLead) in the spaces provided.</li>
            <li>
              Since the is to be only one site lead, the "Number of Slots" will 
              be one (1), but like the shift supervisors there are two (2) we 
              would ensure the Number of Slots is 2. You can either type in the
              correct number or use the up/down arrows to adjust the value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Type in the "Hours Per Employee" in the space provided.  The 
              default is 1824 and this can be adjusted by using the up/down 
              arrows provided, but this can be time consuming.
            </li>
            <li>
              The last required field is the "Usable Period".  Click the 
              calendar icon to get a calendar to select the first day of the 
              period this Charge Number/Extension can be used, then the last.  
              This is normally the same as the contract period and will be set 
              that way by default, but for codes with shorted period this is 
              where they are set.
            </li>
            <li>
              (Optional Fields - Normally provided by the contract 
              administrator)
              <ol class="level4">
                <li>CLIN - Contract Line Number</li>
                <li>SLIN - (Probably) Supplemental Line Number</li>
                <li>WBS - Work Breakdown Structure</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Empty Slot Name - used in cases where a row in the 
                  report is reserved if the number of employees is below the 
                  number of slots.
                </li>
                <li>Exercise Code - this boolean value is provided in 
                  cases where the code is for exercise support and a separate 
                  section is provided in the final report.  This is a Certificate 
                  of Service report variable.

              </ol>

              the new labor code to the list.
