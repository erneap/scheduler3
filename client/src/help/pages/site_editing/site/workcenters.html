  <h1>Site Workcenter Editing</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>
  <p>
    The workcenter is the intermediate level of separation at the site.  It is 
    assumed that the site will have an admin or leads workcenter, plus two or 
    three other workcenters.  The overall site schedule is produced by 
    workcenter. Each workcenter can be created with multiple 
    shifts and/or positions.  The shift is a designated work period for multiple 
    employees (example: Day shift might cover the period from 6am to 4pm.) In 
    contrast, a position is usually assigned to an individual, regardless of the 
    work period.
