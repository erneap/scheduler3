  <h1>Report Overview/Scenario Example</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>
  <p>
    Two types of reports require a definition to allow for creation.
    <ol class="level1">
      <li>
        The forecast report is a excel-based output that allows the site 
        leadership to track contract accomplishment.  Each contract for support 
        breaks up its accomplishment into periods of time with an allotted number 
        of hours per employee per function.  The contract probably lists a site 
        leader, an admin person, plus several other functional areas.  As an 
        example the site lead might be allocated 1860 hours for a period from 
        1 Oct to 30 Sep.  To define a forecast report, we need a name for it, the 
        report's period and the day of the week each weekly period ends.  Each 
        report's task list contains a series of charge number/extensions to define 
        the positions and hours for the period.
      </li>
      <li>
        The US Government requires the site and site's contract agent to verify 
        or certify and contract accomplishment on a monthly basis.  This report 
        is called a Certificate of Service report or "C of S" report.  It is 
        normally a Adobe PDF Form where data can be imported into the form.  
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Example: </b> I'm going to use this example to explain the report and its 
    components.  The site consists of a site lead, 3 shift supervisors and 30 
    workers in 3 workcenters, each with 3 shifts.
