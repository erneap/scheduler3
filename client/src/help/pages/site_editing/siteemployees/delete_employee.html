    Deleting an employee is a two-step process.  You select the employee from 
    the list in the editor view.  This will bring up their information but we 
    need to view their profile (name information) to delete them.
    <ol class="level1">
      <li>Click the delete button in the upper-right side.  A dialog will open 
        to allow you to verify the deletion.
