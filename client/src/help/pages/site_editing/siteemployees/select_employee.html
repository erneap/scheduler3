  <h1>Select Employee To Edit</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>
  
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      <b>List Hightlights</b>:  I wanted to point out two areas besides the list 
      of employees to edit.  
      <ol class="level2">
        <img src="./images/show_active_only.png" style="width: 250px;">
        <li>
          First, the "Show Active Only" checkbox provides a way to limit the 
          list to only current employees.  Unchecking the checkbox will change
          the list to display anyone in the database who had been assigned to
          your site.
        </li>
        <img src="./images/account_colors.png" style="width: 250px;">
        <li>
          Next, Below the "Show Active Only" is two items: "Password Expired" 
          and "Account Locked".  These are the color coding schemes for the list 
          to show employee's whose accounts are either locked or their password 
          is expired.  The employee's profile view will allow you to change 
          their password (if expired) or to unlock their account (if locked).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Selecting one of the employees in the list will cause that employee's 
      information to the editor views to allow it to be edited.  This includes:
      personal and company information, assign primary labor codes, work 
      assignments, work variations, view PTO/Holiday displays, edit leave 
      manually, leave balances, and leave requests.  Each of these views will 
      be discussed on subsequent help pages.
    </li>
  </ol>
