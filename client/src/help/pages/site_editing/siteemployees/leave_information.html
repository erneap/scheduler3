  <h1>Employee's Leave Information</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>

  <p>
    The Employee will take vacation, holidays or other types of leave from time 
    to time and the companies normally require this tracked to allow the 
    site leadership to advise the employee when they need to take or can't take 
    any more vacation or holidays.  The leave information tab provides displays 
    and views for editing this information.  It is divided into four sub-views:
    <ol class="level1">
      <li>
        PTO/Holiday Display - a quick view of the employee's Holiday and leave 
        use.  Holidays are only displayed for companies that designate holidays 
        for use.  The leaves portion will break out any leave type (other than 
        holidays) and display them by month.  For PTO, or vacation, this is 
        displayed as black lettering for actual dates taken or blue for 
        scheduled dates.  At the bottom, there may be a summary of PTO/Vacation 
        and holidays with the purpose to give a balance the employees possesses 
        for the year selected.  You can view a different year by clicking the 
        &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; at the top of the display to adjust the displayed 
        year backward or forward one year.

      </li>
      <li>
        Leaves Display - This is provided to actually edit a single day of 
        leave or holiday for the employee.  Most leaves and holidays are 
        scheduled and approved using the employee's leave request view, but 
        there are times you will need to edit their leave manually, this is the 
        tool to use.  It will be explained in <a href="leaves_display.html">another 
        help page</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave Balance Display - This view is provided to input the employee's 
        annual leave allocation plus the amount of leave they are bringing into 
        the new calendar year from the old.  It will be explained in <a href=""> 
        Leave Balance help page</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly is the Leave Request Display.  It functions exactly like your own 
        Leave Request editor, except as an approver, you can create, edit, 
        delete and approve leave requests.
