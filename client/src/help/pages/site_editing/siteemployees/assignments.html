  <h1>Editing Employee's Assignment List</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>

  <p>
    An assignment is the normal work schedule for any employee between a period
    of time.  A variation is a temporary change to an assignment, so before and 
    after the variation period the employee will return to their current 
    assignment.
  </p>

  <p><span class="importantNote">When you created a new employee, he/she was 
    automatically assigned to your site through the use of an assignment 
    record.  During the New Employee process, you were asked when they 
    started, this will be the date of the first assignment.  When an employee 
    is transfered to another site, within the contract,  you will create a new 
    assignment record with the date they arrive there.
  </span></p>

  <h2>New Assignment</h2>

  <p><span class="importantNote">You will use a "New Assignment" whenever the 
    employee transfers to a different site, changes work assignment (shift 
    and/or workcenter). This allows the individual to continue to be assigned 
    in the schedule at their current work assignment, then the schedule will 
    smoothly transition to the new assignment.
