    The employee profile editor allows the employee to edit their E-mail address, 
    name and password and space is provided for each.  Add to this the capability 
    to set the employee's role(s) and to unlock their account.  Lastly, the 
    scheduler and/or site leadership can delete the employee from the database
    from this view.

  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      <b>Email Address/Name Editing</b> - Each item is provided space to display 
      what the application has stored and for the employee to edit it.  All 
      changes are saved when the editor either hits the &lt;TAB&gt; key or moves
      the cursor to another place.  To Edit:
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>Place the cursor in the field you wish to change and click the 
          left mouse button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use your keyboard to make any necessary changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Either hit the &lt;TAB&gt; key or click the mouse in any outher field 
          or space outside the display.  The changes are sent to the server at 
          this point.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Password Change</b> - The new password must meet the requirements set
      for the application as minimums (10 characters in length and 2 of each 
      type of character, lower-case, upper-case, numeric, and other characters).
      The steps to change a password are:
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>
          Plave the cursor in the "New Password" field and click the left mouse 
          button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure the field is empty and type in the new password.  If the new 
          password doesn't meet the minimum requirements a warning will be 
          provided below the field.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hit the &lt;TAB&gt; key or click in the "Verify New Password" field.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type in the new password again.  If the two entries don't match, an
          error message with display below this field.  If the new password 
          meets the minimum requirements and the two entries match the "Change"
          button will appear to the right of this field.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click the "Change" button to send the change to the server.

      completely removed from the database.  If the employee transfers to 
      another site, set the end date for the current assignment and create an
      assignment for the new site with a M-F work week.  If the employee quits, 
      retires or otherwise leaves the job, don't delete them, end their 
      assignment.  <u><b>DELETING AN EMPLOYEE IS FOR MISTAKES and Absolutely the 
      last action to take.</b></u>  To Delete, click on the Delete Button 
      ( <img src="./images/delete_button.png" class="icon"> ) and
