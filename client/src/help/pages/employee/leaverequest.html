  <h1>Leave Request Editor</h1>
  <p>
    Requesting Leave of any type starts with this portion of the Scheduler
    application.
  </p>
  <p>
    (NOTE:  As an example to follow, the steps are provided to request a 
    vacation over about a two-week period, but will consist of several holidays
    used in conjunction with the normal vacation days.)

    The leave request editor opens as the blank slate show above, with the 
    possible exception of having previously request leaves shown in the "Current 
    Leave Request" list.

      <b>Drafting a New Leave Request:</b>
      <ol class="level2">
        <img src="./images/leaverequest_calendar.png" style="height: 200px;">
        <li>
          Click on the "Request Dates" field's calendar icon on the right side.  
          A calendar will display to allow you to select the inclusive dates for 
          the leave.  These must include regular days off, so that if your 
          work schedule assignment changes the leave can be recalculated.  Click 
          on the first and last days of this period within the calendar.  
          It should highlight the period selected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, select the "Primary Leave Code" to be used for the majority of
          the leave days displayed.  You can select the leave code to use on
          individual days later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, use your mouse and click the "+" button to the right of the 
          "Primary Leave Code" selector.  This will send this basic information 
          to the server and display the request for further editing, as shown 
          below.
        </li>
        <img src="./images/leaverequest_complete.png">
        <li>
          Now this leave request is in "draft" mode and is only in the DRAFT 
          state.  If you want to change some of the days to Holidays, you can 
          edit individual days by going to that day and changing the type of 
          leave to use/project for that day and the number of hours.  When you 
          change itâ€™s leave type the color scheme will probably change.

            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to change the leave code to be used, say holiday 
              instead of vacation. The date's code display "Vacation" is a 
              selector that allows you to select the code to use.
            </li>
            <li> 
              If you want to change the leave's hours taken/scheduled.  Click 
              next to the number and edit it.
            </li>
            <li>
              All data is saved immediately after the change is made.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          To submit the request for approval, click the "Submit for Approval" 
          button, which changes the status to requested and sends an email to 
          all the approving authorities for approval.

        <p>
          Note the leave request's status information. this tells you the date 
          it was created, it's current status, and if approved, when and by 
          whom is was approved.
        </p>

          <b>Editing a Leave Request</b> - The assumption here is that you 
          changed your mind on the dates or codes to use for a date.  You can 
          make changes to any leave request until the leave is actually taken, 
          even if it has been approved.  (NOTE:  If the leave request is 
          approved and you change the inclusive dates, the status returns to 
          "REQUESTED" and the dates are re-set to the primary leave code.)
          <ol class="level2">
            <img src="./images/leaverequest_list.png" style="height: 200px;">
            <li>
              The first step is to select the desired leave request, you want to 
              edit, from the "Current Leave Requests" list.  This will fill in 
              the leave request data for editing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make any changes to the information you need to change, understanding 
              the status restrictions/changes automatic to any change.  The data 
              is saved immediately after completed.
            </li>

    <li>
      <b>Clearing the Selected Leave Request</b> - Once you choose a leave 
      request to display, the application thinks you are editing that leave
      request.  So to clear off the display and get back to the "Add" mode, 
      click on the Clear button ( <img src="./images/clear_button.png" 
      class="icon"> ) to the right of the "Primary Leave Code" to clear the 
      selected leave request.
    </li>
