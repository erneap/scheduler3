  <h1>Employee Schedule/Calendar</h1>
  <img src="./images/calendar.png" alt="View Layout">
  <p>
    This schedule is provided in calendar format showing all the employee’s 
    work assignments and approved leave during the selected month.  To change 
    the displayed month:
  <ul>
    <li>Click the "&lt;&lt;" button at the top-left to move backward one year</li>
    <li>Click the "&lt;" button at the top-left to move backward one month</li>
    <li>Click the "&gt;" button at the top-left to move forward one month</li>
    <li>Click the "&gt;&gt;" button at the top-left to move forward one year</li>
  </ul>

  The display is view only, so other than selecting the month to view, no 
  other actions are possible.  Grayed out areas are for previous and next 
  month’s days.  Each work or leave day displays with the assigned color scheme 
  for the large code in the middle of each day.  The box in the upper-right of 
  each day block reflects the day of the month, today is colored in a red tint, 
  while weekends are cyan.  The large 1–2-character code in the middle of the 
  day block shows the work or leave code. The word(s) at the bottom of the day 
  block are the only for workdays and show the work center within the site the 
  individual is to work at.  The system determines which code to display by 
  finding the individual’s current work assignment for the day, then checks for 
  any workday variations annotated, and lastly looks for approved leave.  The 
  priority of display is the reverse or leave-variation-assignment data is 
  displayed.
