  <p>The Employee’s PTO/Holiday report shows all the actual and/or approved 
    holidays and leaves to allow the employee to plan and provide a projection 
    of time off to their respective supervisors.  Since some companies provide 
    only vacation time to their employees, the display is based on the company 
    defining their paid holidays, if none are assigned, only the leave portion 
    of the display shown.</p>
    <ol class="level1">
      <li><b>Holiday Display Portion</b> - This display shows the holidays 
      designated by a company for the employee.
        <ul>
          <li>They are defined in the Team's Data Section (Covered Later) and are 
            coded and sortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            The display provides the holiday's code, the date for this holiday 
            within the displayed year, the date the holiday was actually taken by 
            the employee or the date projected to be taken, and the last column 
            shows the number of hours taken/used.
          </li>
          <li>Company policy dictates the standard number of hours for each 
            holiday (application assumes 8 hours) and whether or not partial 
            holidays can be taken and combined.  Partial holidays are shown as a 
            date with the number of hours taken attached.
          </li>
          <li>
            Holidays taken are displayed in black lettering and projected holidays 
            are shown in a blue shade.
          </li>
          <li>
            Holidays are filled into the display in the date order with partial
            holidays combined (up to 8 hours) to show a complete holiday taken.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Leaves Display</b> - This display shows all the other types of time 
        off and employee uses during the year, grouped by month.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Paid-Time-Off (PTO) or vacation time is displayed in the same way as 
            holidays with black lettering for actual dates and a blue shade for 
            projected.
          </li>
          <li>
            All other leaves use a reverse coloring scheme used in the employee
            calendar, so if the leave is shown on the calendar as black lettering
            with a yellow background, this display will show yellow lettering on 
            a black background.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "Taken" and "Projected" columns on the right are to show the 
            amount of taken and projected PTO/Vacation time the employee has 
            taken or scheduled for that month.  The application is written to 
            assume that other types of leave don't count against the employee's 
            vacation total.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Summary Section</b> - The summary at the bottom of the display 
        provides a ready reference for the number of holidays left and the 
        amount of PTO/Vacation time the employee has remaining/unscheduled. 
        <b><u>(This portion of the display will only be shown if leave balances
          are provided to the application by the scheduler/site leadership, so 
          that a balance can be determined.)
        </u></b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The display is again broken down to Holidays and PTO/Vacation 
            sections (left and right).  The holiday section is based on actual 
            holiday time taken, so the totals show the number of holidays not 
            taken yet, the number of hours available to be taken to the end of 
            the year, and the number of hours taken so far.  The PTO/Vacation 
            section shows the number of hours carried over from the previous 
            year, the number of hours projected for the calendar year, the 
            number of hours taken and the number of hours projected.  The 
            balance is simply a calculation of the hours available minus the 
            hours taken/projected or (annual PTO hours + carried forward) – 
            (taken + projected)
