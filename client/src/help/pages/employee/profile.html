      <b>Email Address/Name Editing</b> - Each item is provided space to display 
      what the application has stored and for the employee to edit it.  All 
      changes are saved when the editor either hits the &lt;TAB&gt; key or moves
      the cursor to another place.  To Edit:
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>Place the cursor in the field you wish to change and click the 
          left mouse button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use your keyboard to make any necessary changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Either hit the &lt;TAB&gt; key or click the mouse in any outher field 
          or space outside the display.  The changes are sent to the server at 
          this point.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Password Change</b> - The new password must meet the requirements set
      for the application as minimums (10 characters in length and 2 of each 
      type of character, lower-case, upper-case, numeric, and other characters).
      The steps to change a password are:
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>
          Plave the cursor in the "New Password" field and click the left mouse 
          button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure the field is empty and type in the new password.  If the new 
          password doesn't meet the minimum requirements a warning will be 
          provided below the field.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hit the &lt;TAB&gt; key or click in the "Verify New Password" field.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type in the new password again.  If the two entries don't match, an
          error message with display below this field.  If the new password 
          meets the minimum requirements and the two entries match the "Change"
          button will appear to the right of this field.
        </li>
        <li>
