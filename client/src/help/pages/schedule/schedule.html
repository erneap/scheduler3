  <p>The site schedule view is made up of two portions: the schedule and 
    the legend.  The legend portion show the various color coded schemes and 
    their respective meanings within the schedule.  These color schemes don't 
    include any code where the background and text are displayed for normal 
    work (white background with black lettering).

      and HB/LB).
