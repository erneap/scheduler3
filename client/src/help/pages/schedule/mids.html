 <p>The Mid Rotation Coverage listing provides a ready list of who is working 
  the mid-shift rotation and the start and end dates for their period.  It is 
  a simple list shown in start date order for the entire year.  Mid-shift 
  rotation is set using an assignment variation in the Employee Editor 
  (discussed later) and defines that employee’s work period and days off.  To 
  see a different year’s assignments, use the “&lt;&lt;” and “&gt;&gt;” buttons 
  to move the year backward or forward one year, respectively.
